# Welcome to Real time chat application! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

## Introduction 

This is a Real time chat application, built using React Js, Node Js, Mongodb, Express Js, and socket.io. It can be used to chat with any one.
The chat may be one-on-one chat or may be group chat. It is responsive in nature, which mainly built using Chakra UI. This project gives me a detailed knowledge about building user interface, backend integrated with socket.io to handle reat time chats, reusable components etc. Please explore this app and can provide suggestions.
